## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your machine.
2. Go into the project's root directory, and run the command `npm install`.
3. Run the test suite using the command `npm test`.

If the command `npm test` doest not work, you may need to install mocha globally on your machine. Do this with the command `npm install -g mocha`.

## What we learned working on this project

- I learned how to use Chai's assertion syntax for unit tests.
